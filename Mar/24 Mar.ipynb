    " The wine quality dataset includes 12 input variables that describe the properties of the wines, and one output variable that represents the quality rating of the wine. The input variables are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Fixed acidity: the concentration of non-volatile acids in the wine (measured in g/dm^3).\n",
    "    - Volatile acidity: the concentration of acetic acid in the wine (measured in g/dm^3).\n",
    "    - Citric acid: the concentration of citric acid in the wine (measured in g/dm^3).\n",
    "    - Residual sugar: the amount of residual sugar left in the wine after fermentation (measured in g/dm^3).\n",
    "    - Chlorides: the concentration of salt in the wine (measured in g/dm^3).\n",
    "    - Free sulfur dioxide: the concentration of SO2 that is not bound to other molecules in the wine (measured in mg/dm^3).\n",
    "    - Total sulfur dioxide: the total concentration of SO2 in the wine (measured in mg/dm^3).\n",
    "    - Density: the density of the wine (measured in g/cm^3).\n",
    "    - pH: the acidity level of the wine.\n",
    "    - Sulphates: the concentration of sulfur compounds in the wine (measured in g/dm^3).\n",
    "    - Alcohol: the percentage of alcohol in the wine.\n",
    "    - Quality: a rating of the wine's quality, ranging from 0 (very bad) to 10 (very excellent).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these features plays a role in determining the overall quality rating of the wine. For example, acidity can affect the taste and mouthfeel of the wine, while alcohol content can affect its body and flavor. The concentration of sulfur compounds can also have an impact on the wine's aroma and flavor. By analyzing these features, we can build a model that predicts the quality of the wine based on its properties."

    "Handling missing data is an important part of feature engineering. In the wine quality dataset, there are no missing values. However, if there were missing values, one approach would be to use imputation techniques to fill in the missing values. There are several different imputation techniques, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.\n",

    "One technique is mean imputation, where missing values are replaced with the mean value of the non-missing values for that feature. This approach is simple and easy to implement, but it can lead to biased estimates if the missing data is not missing at random. Another technique is median imputation, where missing values are replaced with the median value of the non-missing values for that feature. This approach is less sensitive to outliers than mean imputation, but it can also lead to biased estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another technique is K-nearest neighbor (KNN) imputation, where missing values are replaced with the average of the K-nearest neighbors based on the other features. This approach can produce better estimates than mean or median imputation, but it can be computationally expensive and may not work well with high-dimensional data"

To determine the minimum number of principal components required to explain 90% of the variance in the data, we can calculate the cumulative sum of the explained variance ratios for each principal component and identify the point where the cumulative sum exceeds 0.9. In this dataset, it is found that 7 principal components are required to explain 90% of the variance in the data. We can use these principal components as new variables in our models instead of the original variables. This can simplify the model and reduce the risk of overfitting."
